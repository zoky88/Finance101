# Personal Finance Web App

## Description
I am developing this full stack web app in hopes to serve me as my personal finance tracker. Currently I am only focusing on developing mortgage tracker section of the app, before proceeding into building other pages and features. 
Technologies used: HTML, SCSS, C# .NET 8, EF8.0
## Installation
Clone the repo on your local machine and start the project using Visual Studio locally on your machine.
## Usage
Webapp currently has one main page: Mortgage Tracker that contains submit form to input your mortgage details. Once you fill out the form, the data gets send to the database server that handles some calculations and returns all the information back to the front end and display it in general table design. There is then functionality to either submit new data, edit or delete it, so this app functions as a standard CRUD application.
